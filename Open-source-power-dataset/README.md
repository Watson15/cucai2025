# PSML: A Multi-scale Time-series Dataset for Machine Learning in Decarbonized Energy Grids [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5663995.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5663995)

The electric grid is a key enabling infrastructure for the ambitious transition towards carbon neutrality as we grapple with climate change. With deepening penetration of renewable energy resources and electrified transportation, the reliable and secure operation of the electric grid becomes increasingly challenging. In this paper, we present PSML, a first-of-its-kind open-access multi-scale time-series dataset, to aid in the development of data-driven machine learning (ML) based approaches towards reliable operation of future electric grids. The dataset is generated through a novel transmission + distribution (T+D) co-simulation designed to capture the increasingly important interactions and uncertainties of the grid dynamics, containing electric load, renewable generation, weather, voltage and current measurements at multiple spatio-temporal scales. Using PSML, we provide state-of-the-art ML baselines on three challenging use cases of critical importance to achieve: (i) early detection, accurate classification and localization of dynamic disturbance events; (ii) robust hierarchical forecasting of load and renewable energy with the presence of uncertainties and extreme events; and (iii) realistic synthetic generation of physical-law-constrained measurement time series. We envision that this dataset will enable advances for ML in dynamic systems, while simultaneously allowing ML researchers to contribute towards carbon-neutral electricity and mobility.

## Package Usage
We've prepared the standard interfaces of data loaders and evaluators for all of the three time series tasks:
#### (1) Data loaders
We prepare the following Pytorch data loaders, with both data processing and splitting included. You can
easily load data with a few lines for different tasks by simply modifying the `task` parameter.
```python
from Code.dataloader import TimeSeriesLoader

loader = TimeSeriesLoader(task='forecasting', root='./PSML') # suppose the raw dataset is downloaded and unzipped under Open-source-power-dataset
train_loader, test_loader = loader.load(batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
```
#### (2) Evaluators
We also provide evaluators to support fair comparison among different approaches. 
The evaluator receives the dictionary `input_dict` (we specify key and value format of different tasks in `evaluator.expected_input_format`), 
and returns another dictionary storing the performance measured by task-specific metrics (explanation of key and value can be found in `evaluator.expected_output_format`).
```python
from Code.evaluator import TimeSeriesEvaluator
evaluator = TimeSeriesEvaluator(task='classification', root='./PSML') # suppose the raw dataset is downloaded and unzipped under Open-source-power-dataset
# learn the appropriate format of input_dict
print(evaluator.expected_input_format) # expected input_dict format
print(evaluator.expected_output_format) # expected output dict format
# prepare input_dict
input_dict = {
    'classification': classfication,
    'localization': localization,
    'detection': detection,
}
result_dict = evaluator.eval(input_dict)
# sample output: {'#samples': 110, 'classification': 0.6248447204968943, 'localization': 0.08633372048006195, 'detection': 42.59349593495935}
```
